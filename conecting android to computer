Connecting Android device to the computer 


To let Android Studio communicate with your device, you must turn on USB Debugging on your Android device.

On Android 4.2 and higher, the Developer options screen is hidden by default. To show Developer options and enable USB Debugging:

On your device, open Settings > About phone and tap Build number seven times.
Return to the previous screen (Settings). Developer options appears at the bottom of the list. Tap Developer options.
Enable USB Debugging.
Now you can connect your device and run the app from Android Studio.

Connect your device to your development machine with a USB cable. On the device, you might need to agree to allow USB debugging from your development device.
Click Run in the toolbar at the top of the window. (You might need to select View > Toolbar to see this option.) The Select Deployment Target dialog opens with the list of available emulators and connected devices.
Select your device, and click OK.
